# Shopping List App with Redux

## Overview

The Shopping List App is a web-based application that allows users to manage multiple shopping lists efficiently. This app is built using Redux for state management, ensuring scalable and maintainable code. Users can create, view, update, and delete shopping list items, categorise them, and share lists with others. The app provides offline support and integrates a JSON Server for data storage. User authentication is also implemented to securely manage and protect shopping lists.

## Features

* User Authentication:

** Users must register or log in to access their shopping lists.
** Authentication ensures that shopping lists are securely stored and only accessible by their owners.

## Shopping List Management:

* Users can create, read, update, and delete items in their shopping lists.
* Each list item can include:
** Name
** Quantity
* Optional Notes (for additional details)
* Categories and Tags can be assigned to each item to better organise the shopping list.

## Multiple Lists:

* Users can create multiple shopping lists for different purposes (e.g., groceries, household items, etc.).
* Each list can be managed independently, with options to share them with other users.

## Search Functionality:

* A search feature is implemented to help users find items quickly by keyword.

## Sorting and Filtering:

* Users can sort and filter shopping items by different criteria such as:
** Name (Alphabetical order)
** Category (E.g., Groceries, Household)
** Date Added or Last Updated


## Offline Support:

* The app is designed to work offline. Users can manage their lists while offline, and any changes made will sync with the server once the app is back online.

## Sharing Lists:

* Users can share shopping lists with other users by generating a shareable link or via email.
 
## CRUD Functionality:

* Create: Add new shopping items to the list.
* Read: View all existing shopping items and details.
* Update: Modify the name, quantity, or notes of existing items.
* Delete: Remove items from the list.

## Redux Setup

* Redux Store: The app uses Redux to manage the global state, making it easier to handle the app's data across multiple components.
* Actions: Actions are dispatched to add, update, and delete items, and to handle authentication and list sharing.
* Reducers: Reducers update the state based on the actions dispatched.
* Middleware: Redux middleware such as Redux Thunk is used to handle asynchronous actions, like making API requests to the JSON server.
